Welcome to my new site and blog. My old single-page site was starting to get a
bit stale for my tastes, so I decided it was time to throw it out, and start
afresh.

This time around my site is generated entirely with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io),
a neat tool for statically generating websites out of markdown and some
templates.

I played around with a few themes for a while, but couldn't find one I liked
enough that I could tweak to suit my needs easily, so in the grand tradition of
Not-Invented-Here syndrome I wrote my own from scratch.

Stay tuned for further updates!
